# ungrouped_reports
Code for creating ungrouped reports using the Sentimeter API

The code added in multiple files serves as a baseline for creating ungrouped reports by connecting to an API which holds data in the JSON format.

In order to use the code, download the complete project files and run them by passing the correct API key and authentication credentials to the API endpoint.

This code repository may also serve as a tutorial to all clients of Sentimeter who would like to access the raw data for their respective organizations.

It can be used to understand how to structure the nested JSON data in a format that may fulfill the end user requirement.
